# DataReview

This repository provides a data-review program designed for review of NSF/NCAR GV archived data. It was written for reviewing results from a reprocessing effort in 2014--2015, but it is also useful for quality control during projects. The normal usage is as a shiny app, but there is also a 'Review.R' script suitable for batch processing to construct a standard set of PDF-format plots for review and archiving. 

The routines depend on functions in a package called 'Ranadu', also in a github repository under this same user name, so that needs to be installed as a package for this to run.
